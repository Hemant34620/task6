🧪 Passwords Tested:

1. **sunil123**  
   - Strength: ❌ Weak  
   - Time to Crack: Less than 1 second  
   - Feedback: Common word + number combo. Very easy to guess.

2. **Sunil@2024**  
   - Strength: ⚠️ Medium  
   - Time to Crack: A few hours  
   - Feedback: Better with use of uppercase and symbols, but still predictable.

3. **S#9uNiL_20@25xyz!**  
   - Strength: ✅ Very Strong  
   - Time to Crack: Trillions of years  
   - Feedback: Excellent use of length and varied character sets.

4. **Z$u8&Lk#02!mA%Rx7^Gp**  
   - Strength: ✅ Very Strong  
   - Time to Crack: Over 4000 trillion years  
   - Feedback: Very high randomness, excellent security level.

📚 Key Learnings:

- Short passwords with simple patterns are easy to crack.
- Adding uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters makes a password stronger.
- **Password length is the biggest factor** in increasing resistance to brute-force attacks.
- **Use passphrases or random strings** instead of names/dates.
- Always use **unique passwords** for every account.

🛡️ Summary of Password Attack Types:

- **Brute Force**: Tries every possible combination (fast against short/simple passwords).
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses common words, names, and patterns.
- **Credential Stuffing**: Uses stolen passwords from previous breaches.

📌 Conclusion:
Complex, long, and random passwords significantly improve your defense against cyberattacks. Tools like security.org help measure password strength and guide users to adopt secure practices.
