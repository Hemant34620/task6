## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Password strength increases with:
  - Longer length (12+ characters)
  - Use of uppercase + lowercase + symbols + numbers
  - Avoiding personal names, dates, and dictionary words

- Strong passwords defend better against:
  - ✅ Brute-force attacks
  - ✅ Dictionary attacks
  - ✅ Credential stuffing

- Use a **password manager** to store and generate secure passwords.

---

## 🔓 Password Attack Types

- **Brute Force**: Tries all combinations.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Tries common and leaked passwords.
- **Credential Stuffing**: Uses real stolen credentials.
